# Notes on using this project
## Docker compose
- The docker-compose file contains placeholder entries for the backend and database, un-comment them to use.
- The backend placeholder is currently set to run a local docker project, you will need to provide the path to that project's dockerfile, or provide an image via an image repo
- You will need to un-comment code in the nginx.conf if you choose to use the backend project.
